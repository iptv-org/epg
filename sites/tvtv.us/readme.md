### Download the guide

npm run grab --- --site=tvtv.us --delay=2000
```

**IMPORTANT:** Keep in mind that with a large number of requests the server may start responding with the error [429 Too Many Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429). In this case, try increasing the `--delay` (1000 = 1 second) or create a [custom channel list](https://github.com/iptv-org/epg?tab=readme-ov-file#use-custom-channel-list) with only the channels you need.

### Test

```sh
npm test --- tvtv.us
